# University Examination Management Portal (UMEP)
UMEP stores exam-related data such as students’ information, professors’ information, and all other exam-related details such as course, department, subjects, etc.\
\
The administrator can choose the subject according to the date, select classrooms, semesters, subjects, branches, and allot professors for supervision. Every piece of information will be stored in our database system.\
The examination department does not have to make separate data excel management sheets. UEMP can easily manage and print all the scheduled data. Students can even know their seating arrangement.\
\
The system easily prints the specific exam date and seating plan data and gets the overall seating arrangement list.\
Professors can also get the details about which class they are supposed to supervise according to the allotment done by the system.\
This system helps to know the current examination status of a student as well as the information of the professor.

# Purpose
The primary goal of the UEMP is to manage the details of the examination based on branch, courses, year, time-slots, and semester and prepare a seating plan and assign supervisors.\
\
The project aims to build an application program to reduce the manual work for the tedious process of managing the examination process.
